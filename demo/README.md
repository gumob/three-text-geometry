## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`
Runs the application in development mode. It enables hot reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time. Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view the application in your browser.

### `pnpm build`
Builds the application for production. It optimizes the build for the best performance and outputs the files to the `build` directory. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for better caching.

### `pnpm lint`
Runs the linter to check for code quality and style issues. It helps ensure that the code adheres to the defined coding standards and best practices.

### `pnpm preview`
Serves the production build locally for previewing. This command allows you to test the production build before deploying it to ensure everything works as expected.
